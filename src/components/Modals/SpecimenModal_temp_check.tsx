// This tool call is actually to prepare the full replacement of SpecimenModal because adding search logic via 'replace' is messy.
// But first I should probably define the types locally if I don't want to import everything.
// Let's just create a new component file for clarity ? No, refactor existing.
// I will rewrite SpecimenModal.tsx completely in the next step to include Project Search.
